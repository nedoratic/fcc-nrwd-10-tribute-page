                <h2 id="headline">Who is Jesus Christ?</h2>
                <p class="justify">Jesus Christ is also known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus the Nazarene. According to Christian belief, he was a Jewish preacher and rabbi from Nazareth. After his martyrdom and resurrection, he became a central figure in Christianity and an important figure in several other religions. Muslims consider him a prophet (Isa), Hindus see him as an avatar, and Christians regard him as the Messiah and the Son of God (Jesus Christ).</p>
                <p class="justify">Jesus presented his teachings in the form of short allegorical stories, using everyday life examples to convey spiritual messages. Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Jew from Galilee, regarded as a teacher and healer. He was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified in Jerusalem by order of the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, accused of conspiracy against the Roman Empire. The main sources of information about Jesus' life and teachings are the four Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The majority of contemporary Bible scholars believe that the ancient accounts of Jesus' life are historically accurate.</p>
                <p class="justify">Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah (Jesus Christ) whose coming was foretold in the Old Testament, which is the main point of their divergence from Judaism. Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is the incarnation of God, the Son of God who came to bring salvation and reconciliation with God, and who rose from the dead after his crucifixion. Other Christian beliefs include Jesus' immaculate conception, miracles, fulfillment of biblical prophecies, ascension into heaven, and the second coming of Christ.</p>
                <p class="justify">Jesus was born in Israel 2000 years ago. Modern civilization marks his birth by dividing time B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini - or the year of our Lord). For his first thirty years, Jesus lived a traditional Jewish life, working as a carpenter. During this time, all of Israel was under Caesar's Roman dictatorship, including Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, and Nazareth, where he was raised.</p>
                <p class="justify">In his thirties, Jesus began his public teaching and display of recorded miracles, yet still never travelled more than 200 miles from his birthplace. Over a three year period, despite his efforts to keep a low profile, Jesus' reputation spread nation wide. The Roman governors and rulers of Israel's provinces and the leaders of the Jewish people (the religious counsels) took note of him.</p>
                <p class="justify">Jesus' most controversial act was that he repeatedly claimed to be God, which was a direct violation of the Jewish law. Therefore the religious leaders asked the Roman government to execute him. In each of several official trials, the Romans found that he was not guilty of breaking any Roman law. Even the Jewish leaders recognized that other than Jesus' claim to be God, Jesus followed the Jewish law perfectly. Still the religious leaders, using the argument of political disfavor, persuaded Pilate, a Roman governor of the Southern province of Israel, to authorize an execution.</p>
                <p class="justify">Jesus was brutally tortured and then hung by his hands, which were nailed to a horizontal wooden beam (cross). This method of execution restricted the airflow to his lungs, killing him in three hours. However, according to more than 500 witnesses, Jesus returned from the dead three days later, and over the next 40 days journeyed in both the southern and northern provinces of Israel. To many, this was conclusive proof that Jesus' claims to be God were real. Then Jesus returned to Jerusalem, the city where he was recently executed, and according to witnesses, he left the earth alive by rising up into the sky.</p>
                <p class="justify">As a result of these miraculous events, the number of his followers increased dramatically. Only a few months later in that same city of Jerusalem one record states that some 3000 new followers were added in a single day. The religious leaders responded by trying to stomp out Jesus' followers. Many of these people chose to die rather than deny their belief that Jesus was truly God.</p>
                <p class="justify">Within 100 years, people throughout the Roman empire (Asia Minor, Europe) became followers of Jesus. In 325 AD, the following of Jesus, Christianity, became the official religion of the Roman Emperor Constantine. Within 500 years, even Greece's temples of Greek gods were transformed into churches for followers of Jesus. Although some of Jesus' messages and teachings were diluted or miscommunicated through the expansion of a religious institution, Jesus' original words and life still speak loudly for themselves.</p>
